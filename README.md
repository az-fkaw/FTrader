# FTrader
Complete set of tools for successful swing trading

## Project Blueprint

### Define Trading Strategies and Criteria
Formalizing the edge for each strategy. For example:
-	Strategies:
    -	Breakout trading
    -	Trend following
    -	Mean reversion
    -	Candlestick patterns (e.g., bullish engulfing, doji)
-	Criteria for Each:
    -	Indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI thresholds)
    -	Volume conditions
    -	Support/resistance levels
    -	Price action patterns
    -	Timeframes (e.g., daily, weekly)
-	These strategies will form the rule set for scanning assets and scoring patterns.
 
### Asset Analysis
The application should:
-	Periodically analyze the price action for all selected assets.
-	Use a scheduling tool (e.g., cron, apscheduler) to trigger daily scans after market close.
-	Incorporate data sources:
    -	Fetch historical price data from APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or your broker's API).
    -	Fetch live data if required for intraday trading adjustments.

Outputs:
-	Pattern recognition: Identify setups based on defined criteria.
-	Scoring: Quantify the strength of a setup (tie this to the scorecard).
 
### Scoring Opportunities & Proposing Risk
-	Apply risk scorecard (A+, A, B, C grades) to rank opportunities.
-	Include risk management suggestions:
    -	Recommended position size based on account balance, grade, stop loss, and daily risk limits.
-	Integrate the scoring with the Streamlit UI so users can filter opportunities by score, asset, or strategy.
 
### Trading Database
For trades:
-	Design a database schema:
    -	Trades: Store key details (e.g., entry date, setup, score, risk, exit date, profit/loss).
    -	Assets: Store asset-specific details (e.g., symbol, volatility metrics).
    -	Users
-	Ensure persistent storage:
    -	Use SQLite or PostgreSQL for backend storage.
    -	Synchronize the database with GitHub for persistence (e.g., using git commands programmatically or GitHub Actions).
-	Track performance:
    -	Generate reports (e.g., win/loss ratios, average R, success rate by strategy).
 
### Frontend with Streamlit
-	Design a user-friendly interface for:
    -	Dashboard:
        -	Show daily opportunities with scores.
        -	Risk management recommendations.
-	Trading Journal:
    -	Input trades and review historical trades.
    -	Filter by date, strategy, or score.
-	Analytics:
    -	Performance reports (e.g., profit/loss by strategy, risk-adjusted returns).
        -	Add user-based functionality:
-	Login and authentication.
-	Personal databases for each user.
 
### Hosting and Streamlit Persistence
-	Database Hosting:
    -   Host the database on GitHub and synchronize it with Streamlit using GitHub APIs.
-	Streamlit Deployment:
	-   Host the app on Streamlit Community Cloud
-	GitHub Integration:
    -	Automatically update the database after each trade entry using GitHub Actions or API calls.
 
Implementation Roadmap
-	Initial Setup:
    -	Create a GitHub repository with basic structure:
        -	/data for database or data files.
        -	/src for backend logic.
        -	/streamlit for frontend code.
-	Build Trading Logic:
    -	Develop trading strategies, scoring logic, and risk management.
    -	Test pattern recognition on historical data.
-	Backend Development:
    -	Set up the SQLite/PostgreSQL database.
    -	Develop APIs for data access (if required).
-	Streamlit Frontend:
    -	Create basic dashboards for opportunity scoring and trade entry.
-	Persistent Storage:
    -	Implement GitHub integration or cloud-based storage for the database.
-	User Management:
    -	Add login/authentication and user-specific data handling.
-	Testing and Deployment:
    -	Test the app locally and on a hosted platform (e.g., Streamlit Community Cloud).
 
Next:
-	Kickstart Backend Development:
    -	Define the database schema.
    -	Implement one or two trading strategies with scoring logic.
-	Basic Streamlit Interface:
    -	Create a placeholder dashboard for entering account balance, viewing opportunities, and logging trades.
